 git-flow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Implementation at FNAL (based on presention by A. Lyon for git at g-2):
1) The default branch is master. This is the branch used for official releases and developers 
   should not commit directly to master. Everything in master needs to work!
2) The develop branch is the latest release candidate. Ideally, everything in develop works, 
   but sometimes it won't. Developers should not commit directly to develop either.
3) Users create feature branches to work on specific features of the code. Feature branches may
   be published and other developers can track each other's feature branches.

Git-Flow Wrapper Script: Simplify all the steps to enforce the development philosophy.

git flow feature start {newFeature}
git flow feature publish
... Work ...
git flow feature finish
git push orign develop

git flow feature track {newFeature}

git flow release start v9_3_8
... Bump the verson number ...
git commit -a -m 'Bump to version v9_3_8'
git flow release finish
git push --all ; git push --tags
