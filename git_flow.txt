Implementation at FNAL:
1) The default branch is master. This is the branch used for official releases and developers 
   should not commit directly to master. Everything in master needs to work!
2) The develop branch is the latest release candidate. Ideally, everything in develop works, 
   but sometimes it won't. Developers should not commit directly to develop either.
3) Users create feature branches to work on specific features of the code. Feature branches may
   be published and other developers can track each other's feature branches.
