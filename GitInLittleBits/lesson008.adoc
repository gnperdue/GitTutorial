Lesson 8 - More on Handling Interrupts: Stashes
-----------------------------------------------
[[lesson-008]]

When working on complicated projects, we have to interrupt work much more often
than we would like.

Command Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[summary-008]]

What have we done, and how would we reproduce our repository so far?
We would first follow the summary from the previous section <<summary-007>>.
Then, we would enter:

---------------------
echo 'this is another bug' >> bar.txt
git commit -a -m "Add another feature to bar.txt"
echo 'this is incomplete feature beta' >> baz.txt
git stash save "working on feature beta"
git stash show
perl -p -i -e 's/bug/feature/g' bar.txt
git commit -a -m "Fix another bug in bar."
git stash pop
git stash show
echo 'this is completes feature beta' >> baz.txt
git add baz.txt
git commit -m "Add feature alpha to baz."
---------------------
