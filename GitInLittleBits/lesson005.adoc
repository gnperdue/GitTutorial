Lesson 5 - Meeting Branches and Re-attaching our HEAD
-----------------------------------------------------
[[lesson-005]]

Now we know one way to retrieve an older version of the repository, but there is 
a problem - remember that ``detached HEAD'' message we ignored in the last lesson?
Well, we really ought to fix that before we go any further.

In order to do that we need to know what a _branch_ is. Without getting into too 
much depth, a branch is a way to experiment with large-scale changes safely. It
starts with a given version of your repository and you can make whatever changes 
you like while preserving an easy-to-retrieve version back where the branch 
started. 

Branches make collaboration much easier and safer.
