Lesson 6 - Start Working with Branches
--------------------------------------
[[lesson-006]]

The basic, fundamental approach to working with Git is to always work on a branch.
Never work on +master+. In some other VCSs, this approach would be awkward, but 
Git works very well in this mode. 

Now, of course, you don't _have_ to work on a branch. Sometimes it really is 
appropriate to work on the +master+ branch. But you'll find that building the 
habit of working on branches will pay off later in more complex situations. 
You'll also find branches give you much more freedom to experiment, because there 
is less risk of a mistake being hard to unwind.

Okay, enough propaganda, let's get to work.
