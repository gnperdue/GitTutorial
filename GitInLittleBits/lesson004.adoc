Lesson 4 - Retrieving Files (Changesets)
----------------------------------------

In the previous lesson, we learned that previous commits are identified by a 
hash key. What wasn't obvious from the example is that Git doesn't give 
individual files hashes, it gives _changesets_ hashes. Git operates on groups
of changes - this is why the concept of staging is important. It allows us 
to craft meaningful commits that introduce full features. Later, this will make
it easier for us to go back to meaningful earlier states once we've learend to 
take advantage of these features.
